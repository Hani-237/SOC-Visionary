ðŸš€ About the Project
This repository is part of the Summer of Code 2025 initiative. The goal was to dive deep into the core concepts of deep learning with PyTorch by building neural networks manually and exploring advanced methods hands-on.

The journey began with data analysis and progressed through constructing, training, and refining models â€” eventually applying transfer learning using pretrained models like ResNetâ€‘18. This process provided a solid mix of theoretical knowledge and real-world coding practice in developing and evaluating deep learning models.

ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside the Repo:

Complete code for all assignments

Reflections and personal insights from each stage

ðŸ§  What Iâ€™ve Learned

ðŸ“Œ 1. Exploring the Dataset

Worked on Fashionâ€‘MNIST, a collection of grayscale clothing images

Applied preprocessing steps like normalization, reshaping, and flattening

Used NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib for visualization and pattern analysis

ðŸ“Œ 2. Basics of Neural Networks

Learned the mechanics of feedforward networks and how training works

Created custom implementations for ReLU, loss functions, and optimizers

Designed training loops using loss.backward() and optimizer.step()

Tackled overfitting issues using dropout layers

Compared performance between Adam and SGD optimizers

ðŸ“Œ 3. Enhancing Model Accuracy

Introduced batch normalization to improve training stability

Used Xavier initialization for better weight distribution

Analyzed and compared training curves for loss and accuracy

ðŸ“Œ 4. Applying Transfer Learning with ResNetâ€‘18

Gained insight into transfer learning and pretrained model usage

Adapted ResNetâ€‘18 to handle grayscale images and 10 output classes

Froze early layers and fine-tuned the deeper parts of the model

Evaluated the results using confusion matrices and accuracy scores
