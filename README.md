# SOC-Visionary
ðŸš€ About the Project
This project is part of Summer of Code 2025. The aim was to explore and master the fundamentals of deep learning using PyTorch, by implementing neural networks from scratch and experimenting with advanced techniques.

I started with data exploration and moved step-by-step through building, training, and improving modelsâ€”culminating in transfer learning with pretrained architectures like ResNetâ€‘18. Along the way, I gained both theoretical foundations and practical experience in model development and evaluation.
